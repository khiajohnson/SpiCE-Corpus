# Recording setup

All of the recordings in the SpiCE corpus were created by two Cantonese-English bilingual research assistants, in a quiet room in Stores Road Annex at the University of British Columbia. The participant and research assistants were all seated around a table during the session&mdash;Nancy Yiu conducted the interviews, and Ivan Fong managed the recording process.
