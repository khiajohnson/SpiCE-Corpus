Procedures
**********

Participants spent approximately 90 minutes in the lab,
and completed three tasks for each language.
The order of languages was counterbalanced.

Task 1: Sentence reading
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Participants read a fixed set of sentences in each language. 

Task 2: Storyboard narration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Participant narrated a cartoon in both languages. The cartoon 
was originally developed for field research and elicited 
vocabulary related to family members and simple gift-giving.

topics such as culture, food, school, hobbies, and family.

Transcription & Annotation
**************************

Broadly, the pipeline follows these steps:

1. Initial transcripts produced with `Google Cloud Speech-to-Text <https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/>`_

2. Hand-correction of orthographic transcripts by researchers

3. Forced-alignment with the `Montreal Forced Aligner <https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_

Prior to the first release of the SpiCE corpus,
detailed transcriber guidlines will be posted here.
