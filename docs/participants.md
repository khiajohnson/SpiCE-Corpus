## Speech community

The Cantonese-speaking community in Metro Vancouver is a unique bilingual community. Not only is Cantonese very widely spoken in the area, it has been for a *long time*, and by a heterogeneous group of people. Statistics Canada has some useful visualizations for getting a broad picture of the linguistic landscape&mdash;in particular: [Proportion of mother tongue responses for various regions in Canada from the 2016 Census](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/dv-vd/lang/index-eng.cfm). There is a lot more that could be said here, but we'll keep it brief for now!

## Participant recruitment

Thirty-four early Cantonese-English bilinguals were recruited from the UBC community in Metro Vancouver, BC, Canada. They were recruited via word of mouth, social media, clubs, the linguistics subject pool, and other similar methods. A detailed summary of the participants' language background information is provided in the [corpus download](download.md). The group of participants recruited for SpiCE reflects the heterogeneity of the speech community.
