# Interview session procedures

Before coming to the session, all participants completed the UBC Linguistics department language background Qualtrics survey through their [UBC Linguistics SONA](https://ubclinguistics.sona-systems.com/) account&mdash;a summary of their responses is included in the [corpus download](download.md).

During the recording session, participants spent approximately 90 minutes in the lab, and completed three tasks for each language (see below). Written informed consent was provided at the beginning of the session. The tasks were ordered from most structured to least structured.

The order of languages was counterbalanced&mdash;half completed the Cantonese interview first, and the other half completed the English interview first (this information is included in the participant summary file and file names, see below). Participants were given a break between interviews if they wanted one. 

## Task 1: Sentences

Participants read a fixed set of sentences in each language, read in order.

The Cantonese sentences were Chinese New Year themed sentences that were expected to be familiar to participants. Participants were presented with Cantonese characters, [Jyutping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyutping), and the English translation simultaneously. This was done, as not all participants were expected to be able to read in Cantonese.

## Task 2: Storyboard

Participant narrated the same cartoon in both languages, usually in just a few minutes. The cartoon&mdash;[Thank You Notes](http://totemfieldstoryboards.org/stories/thank_you_notes/)&mdash;was originally developed by Patrick Littell for linguistics field research and elicited vocabulary related to family members and simple gift-giving. While participants only viewed one panel at a time, here's what the cartoon looked like as a whole:

## Task 3: Interview

The conversational interview accounted for the bulk of the session, and typically lasted around 25 minutes. covered a variety of everyday topics such as culture, food, school, hobbies, and family. The sequence of topics with potential follow-up prompts and questions is available in the following documents. Note that the interviews were dynamic, in that the interviewer went along with what the participant wanted to discuss!
