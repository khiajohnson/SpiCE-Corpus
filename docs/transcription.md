# How the files were transcribed

Broadly, the transcription pipeline followed these steps:

1. Initial transcripts produced with Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
2. Hand-correction of orthographic transcripts by researchers (additional detail to be provided by time of release)
3. Forced-alignment with the Montreal Forced Aligner
