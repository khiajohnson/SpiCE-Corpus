### Funding

SpiCE was funded by University of British Columbia [Public Scholars Initiative](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/psi) and Arts Graduate Research Awards to Khia A.

### License 

Spice is freely available under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). That means you can use, copy, share, and adapt it, as long as you don't release your adaptation with additional restrictions, *and* you cite the corpus. We'd love to hear about what you're doing with the corpus, and [feature you on the research page](research.md)!!

### How to cite the corpus

As stated on the [home page](index.md), we prefer that you cite the corpus directly:

```text
@data{johnson_spice_2021,
	author = {Johnson, Khia},
	publisher = {Scholars Portal Dataverse},
	title = {SpiCE: Speech in Cantonese and English},
	year = {2021},
	version = {DRAFT VERSION},
	doi = {10.5683/SP2/MJOXP3},
	url = {https://doi.org/10.5683/SP2/MJOXP3}
} 
```

But if you can't do that, then you can also cite the following paper:

```text
@inproceedings{johnson_lrec_2020,
    title = {SpiCE: A new open-access corpus of conversational bilingual speech in Cantonese and English},
    author = {Johnson, Khia A. and Babel, Molly and Fong, Ivan and Yiu, Nancy},
    booktitle = {Proceedings of the 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference},
    month = may,
    year = {2020},
    address = {Marseille, France},
    publisher = {European Language Resources Association},
    url = {https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.lrec-1.503},
    pages = {4089--4095},
    language = {English},
    ISBN = {979-10-95546-34-4},
}
```
