## About the corpus

SpiCE is a forthcoming open-access corpus of conversational bilingual Speech in Cantonese and English. SpiCE includes high-quality audio recordings of 30-minute interviews with 34 early bilinguals in each language. This project is supported by the UBC Public Scholars Initiative and a SSHRC grant held by Dr. Molly Babel. The initial release was planned for the end of January 2021, but it's shaping up to be more like mid-February.
