<p>This page covers general information about SpiCE, as well as how the corpus was collected. Anything that happened <em>after</em> the recordings were made is covered on the (following) <a href="../transcription/">transcription</a> page. You could also read the <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.lrec-1.503/">open-access paper describing the corpus</a>.</p>
<h2 id="spice-is-a-phonological-corpus">SpiCE is a phonological corpus</h2>
<p>What's that? A phonological corpus for spoken language has audio recordings, linguistic annotations at the level of the word and phone, as well as metadata. A phonological corpus should also be representative of the selected population, big enough, and collected for a purpose. SpiCE is a phonological corpus, albeit one with <em>force-aligned phones</em>. A future release might include hand-corrected phones, but that's a big ❓ at the moment!</p>
<h2 id="the-speech-community">The speech community</h2>
<p>The Cantonese-speaking community in Metro Vancouver is a unique bilingual community. Not only is Cantonese very widely spoken in the area, it has been for a <em>long time</em>, and by a heterogeneous group of people. Statistics Canada has some useful visualizations for getting a broad picture of the linguistic landscape&mdash;in particular: <a href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/dv-vd/lang/index-eng.cfm">Proportion of mother tongue responses for various regions in Canada from the 2016 Census</a>. There is a lot more that could be said here, but we'll keep it brief for now!</p>
<h2 id="participants">Participants</h2>
<p>Thirty-four early Cantonese-English bilinguals were recruited from the UBC community in Metro Vancouver, BC, Canada. They were recruited via word of mouth, social media, clubs, the linguistics subject pool, and other similar methods. A detailed summary of the participants' language background information is provided in the <a href="../download/">corpus download</a>. The group of participants recruited for SpiCE reflects the heterogeneity of the speech community.</p>
<h2 id="recording-setup">Recording setup</h2>
<p>All of the recordings in the SpiCE corpus were created by two Cantonese-English bilingual research assistants, in a quiet room in Stores Road Annex at the University of British Columbia. The participant and research assistants were all seated around a table during the session&mdash;Nancy Yiu conducted the interviews, and Ivan Fong managed the recording process. Recordings were made with the following tools, equipment, and settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a></li>
<li>A PC laptop</li>
<li>Sound Devices USBPre2 Portable Audio Interface</li>
<li>AKG C520 head-mounted microphones</li>
<li>Stereo (L: participant, R: interviewer), with the exception of one mono file with just the participant</li>
<li>44.1 KHz sampling rate</li>
<li>24-bit resolution</li>
</ul>
<p>Prior to participating, all participants completed the UBC Linguistics department language background Qualtrics survey through their <a href="https://ubclinguistics.sona-systems.com/">UBC Linguistics SONA</a> account&mdash;a summary of their responses is included in the <a href="../download/">corpus download</a>.</p>
<h2 id="procedures">Procedures</h2>
<p>Participants spent approximately 90 minutes in the lab, and completed three tasks for each language (see below), after providing written informed consent. The tasks were ordered from most structured to least structured.</p>
<p>The order of languages was counterbalanced&mdash;half completed the Cantonese interview first, and the other half completed the English interview first (this information is included in the participant summary file and file names, see below). Participants were given a break between interviews if they wanted one. </p>
<h3 id="task-1-sentences">Task 1: Sentences</h3>
<p>Participants read a fixed set of sentences in each language, read in order.</p>
<p>The Cantonese sentences were Chinese New Year themed sentences that were expected to be familiar to participants. Participants were presented with Cantonese characters, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyutping">Jyutping</a>, and the English translation simultaneously. This was done, as not all participants were expected to be able to read in Cantonese.</p>

<h3 id="task-2-storyboard">Task 2: Storyboard</h3>
<p>Participant narrated the same cartoon in both languages, usually in just a few minutes. The cartoon&mdash;<a href="http://totemfieldstoryboards.org/stories/thank_you_notes/">Thank You Notes</a>&mdash;was originally developed by Patrick Littell for linguistics field research and elicited vocabulary related to family members and simple gift-giving. While participants only viewed one panel at a time, here's what the cartoon looked like as a whole:</p>
